### Motivation / Background
Owning a vehicle comes with many nuisances. Those who are moving into new cities will have to take into account parking availability, commute times, costs of parking, and many other variables when deciding to have a car. We aim to provide some context to this problem through visualizations and statistical modeling in order to guide car owners in their decision to own a vehicle in a new city.

### Variables
- AvgTimeToPark: The average time taken to search for parking (in minutes)
- AvgTimeToParkRatio: The ratio between the average time taken to search for parking and of those not searching for parking in the current geohash
- TotalSearching: The number of drivers searching for parking
- PercentSearching: The percentage of drivers that were searching for parking
- AvgUniqueGeohashes: The average number of unique geohashes at the 7 character level (including neighbouring and parking geohashes) that were driven in among vehicles that searched for parking
- AvgTotalGeohashes: The average number of all geohashes at the 7 character level (including neighbouring and parking geohashes) that were driven in among vehicles that searched for parking
- PercentMPV: Percentage of vehicles with parking issues that were multi purpose vehicles
