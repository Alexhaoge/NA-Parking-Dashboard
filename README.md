### Data
This dataset identifies areas within a city where drivers are experiencing difficulty searching for parking. Cities can use this data to identify problem areas, adjust signage, and more. Only cities with a population of more than 100,000 are included.

The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terenceshin/searching-for-parking-statistics-in-north-america). We acknowledge the author [Terence Shin](https://www.kaggle.com/terenceshin) for providing the dataset.
